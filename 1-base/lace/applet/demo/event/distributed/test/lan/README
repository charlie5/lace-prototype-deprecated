Edit /etc/hosts to force usage of 127.0.0.1 by po_cos_naming.

For instance, given ...

/etc/hostname
foo

/etc/hosts
       127.0.0.1       localhost
       192.168.1.10    foo.mydomain.org       foo

... change to ...

/etc/hosts
       127.0.0.1       localhost
#       192.168.1.10    foo.mydomain.org       foo
